# Walkie-Takie

I'm just messing around with Java's DatagramSocket class. I'm streaming audio from my microphone to byte arrays and sending them over the network using Datagrams. I'm picking them up on another port and playing them back through my speakers.

For you to be able to try this, you do need to adjust the ports and IP addresses (we will use the scanner to pick those up).
